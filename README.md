👋 Hi, I’m @AlexJew. I am an energy modeller graduated from EPFL, Switzerland. I share a passion for energy urban infrastructures. Thus, my goal is to help spread successful energy planning practices and contribute to the deployment of new energy infrastructures able to produce, transfer and consume energy in a efficient, flexible and decarbonated way 

👀 I’m interested in any new software that can help promote energy planning worldwide

🌱 I’m currently learning programming, as I try to improve my data management skills

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project related to energy modelling
